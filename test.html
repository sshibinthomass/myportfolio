<h1>VR Underwater Experience - Project Documentation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  I developed an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) application designed for Android
  devices using Unity and Google VR. This application provides users with an
  interactive underwater experience, enabling them to explore four unique
  environments: Tower, Ship, Dance, and Ride. The user interacts with the
  virtual world through intuitive gaze-based navigation.
</p>
<h2>Main Menu and Navigation</h2>
<p>
  Upon launching the application, the Unity logo is displayed, signaling the
  underlying game engine. After loading, the user is greeted with a main menu
  offering the following options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tower</li>
  <li>Dance</li>
  <li>Ship</li>
  <li>Ride</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The menu is controlled using gaze-based input. Users simply look at one of the
  menu options to make a selection.
</p>
<h2>Scenes and Features</h2>
<h3>Tower Section</h3>
<p>
  Selecting the 'Tower' option transports the user to a serene underwater
  environment situated on the seabed. The scene includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blue sharks swimming across the scene.</li>
  <li>A central tower-like structure providing architectural depth.</li>
  <li>Pink and light blue aquatic creatures adding vibrant marine life.</li>
  <li>Realistic seabed details such as rocks, seaweed, and marine flora.</li>
  <li>Darker colored sharks and white whales gliding through the water.</li>
  <li>
    A glowing green orb positioned near the ocean floor to create intrigue.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Ship Section</h3>
<p>
  The 'Ship' environment features a large, partially submerged ship, viewed from
  various angles as the camera pans dynamically. The surroundings include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rocky ocean floor and background elements.</li>
  <li>Colorful aquatic life, including blue and pink sea creatures.</li>
  <li>Presence of black and white whales swimming nearby.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dance Section</h3>
<p>
  In the 'Dance' section, I created a choreographed sequence where marine
  animals move in synchronization, resembling a dance performance. The animated
  scene showcases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light blue whales moving rhythmically.</li>
  <li>Green aquatic creatures joining the formation.</li>
  <li>Orcas (black and white) executing synchronized movements.</li>
  <li>Other various marine species participating in the dance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ride Section</h3>
<p>
  Choosing 'Ride' offers users a guided boat-like journey through the underwater
  world. The ride interface includes basic 'Play' and 'Pause' functionality.
  During the ride, users observe:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Large reddish-brown octopuses with long tentacles gracefully moving through
    the water.
  </li>
  <li>Numerous colorful aquatic animals surrounding the user.</li>
  <li>
    Varied underwater perspectives as the camera glides through the marine
    environment.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Unity:</strong> Game engine used for developing the VR experience
    and managing scenes, lighting, animations, and interactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Google VR SDK:</strong> Integrated for enabling VR support and
    gaze-based input on Android devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Blender:</strong> Used to model and animate 3D marine life such as
    sharks, whales, and octopuses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Android:</strong> Target platform for deployment, tested with Google
    Cardboard and similar devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>C#:</strong> Programming language used within Unity for scripting
    interactions and scene transitions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This project demonstrates the potential of immersive environments for
  educational or entertainment purposes using affordable VR tools. It combines
  realistic underwater visuals with intuitive navigation, resulting in a highly
  engaging user experience.
